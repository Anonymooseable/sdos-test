# SDoS Test Client #

-------

Thank you a lot for using the Sauerbraten Day of Sobriety Test Client!

Please help with testing by sending your feedback.

# What is this? #

This is test client is the foundation of what the anti-cheat client is
built on. It doesn't include any of the anti-cheat functions. The
reason it needs testing is that it uses SDL version 2 rather than
version 1, which the regular Sauerbraten client is built on. This
newer version of SDL brings many improvements that help with both the
normal game and the anti-cheat protections, but it is a major
change. Things could break. We need some help with testing.

You can play with this client on any normal server. It's meant to work
just like the normal sauer client, with some improvements.

# Installation #

The installation is the same as the acc client or the swlacc
builds. If you can't remember the procedure, you can refresh your
memory with the appropriate README in the archive.

# Testing #

The following is some sparse info of what you should consider while
testing. Reports of oddities or bad functioning are important, but
"everything works fine" is helpful too.

- General stability and performance
- Mouse input
  - sensitivity might change. __Do not change your sensitivity with
    the normal variables__. Please tune the variable
    `sdl2_sensitivity_adjust` (default value 1.0), **and report your
    findings**. Was sensitivity different from the standard
    Sauerbraten client, and what value of `sdl2_sensitivity_adjust`
    made it seem the same? This is very important!
  - are all your mouse buttons recognized? If you have a mouse with
    many buttons (more than 3), please test them thoroughfully. If a
    button doesn't seem to be recognized, go in the `binds` options
    panel, and try to bind the button to some action, and note the
    button name, if it shows up
  - the new `relativemouse 0|1` variable is related to the new SDL2
    mouse handling. Default is 1, and 0 seems to never work, but if it
    does for you, please report
- Compatibility with vanilla config and data files
  - new configuration variables should go to `sdos.cfg`, to avoid
    interfering with `config.cfg`
  - are there error messages (undefined variables and such) on
    startup?
  - are there error on startup shown by the vanilla client after the
    test client has been run once, or unwanted modification to
    configuration values?
- Minimization, general window/fullscreen handling
  - can you switch from the test client window/fullscreen to your
    desktop? Try <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, or <kbd>âŒ˜ Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, or
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> too
- Vertical synch
  - variable `vsync` now is only 0 or 1 (-1 does not exist anymore)
  - there is a new variable `vsynctear`, effective if vsync is on,
    which should provide better vsync performance
- <kbd>Ctrl+v</kbd> should finally work on linux, report if this is
  not the case
- Linux users with old OSes (specifically with an old glibc installed,
  found on Debian wheezy) should now be able to run the normal binary,
  not needing anymore an .oldglibc version, report if this is not the
  case
- Bonus pro setting `multipoll 0|1|2`: low latency input
  - `multipoll` allows the engine to keep spinning (read input, update
    world state) while the graphic card is busy drawing. Usually top
    players set `vsync 0` and `maxfps 0` or to a multiple of the monitor
    refresh rate, to obtain a sufficient number of input polls.
    `multipoll` should enable you to avoid this workaround in its entirety,
    and only block the input only when it's really necessary to (that is,
    when the state of the world is drawn so it must not be changed).
    Long story short, the suggested setting is: `/maxfps 0; /vsync 1; /multipoll 2`.
    Please report your impressions, together with the numbers you get
    with `showfps 1`. You may also try different combination of `multipoll`
    values, but what I suggested is theoretically the setting that should
    give you the maximum logic frame rate, while drawing just the right
    amount of frames to have a smooth video without tearing at all, without
    wasting GPU power drawing more frames than your monitor refresh rate.
- `showfps 1` now uses a different internal logic: fps counting should
  be more precise and responsive, but the downside is that the refresh
  rate is now fixed to one second. Also, `showfpsrange 1` has no effect.
