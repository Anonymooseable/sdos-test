The build system is not guaranteed to work on any system setup other than mine. This source is released just FYI, not as something well oiled and production ready.

To build, simply "make".

Use the PREFIX variable to set the build flavor. Since I cross compile from linux 64 bit to linux 32 bit and windows, I do:
	make PREFIX=i686-unknown-linux-gnu	#lin32
	make PREFIX=i686-w64-mingw32		#win32
	make PREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32		#win32
Mac build works only on a native Mac OS. You need the Comman Line Tools and an updated "nasm" (not the Apple stock version), then do simply "make".

If you want to change the optimization flags, use the variable OPTFLAGS.
The cpu architecture (for example, "-march=native") may be set with the CPUINFO flag.
